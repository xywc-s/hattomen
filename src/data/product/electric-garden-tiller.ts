      title: `Amazing Machine`,
      content: `It took me a half an hour to rototill this backyard the way that it is right now! I had rented a giant Rototiller from a big box company and it was so hard to use I returned it. This one is so light and easy to use and it works really amazingly! I am absolutely thrilled and excited about what it has done for my backyard. Definitely want to make sure that the yard has been watered well before you use it though! But wait till it’s not mud. `

      Completly shocked at this price point.<br>
      Takes a beating. Compared to the hassle of renting a big gas powered roto tiller , this little package has already payed for itself.  `
