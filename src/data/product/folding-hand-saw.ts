  points: [
    'HIGH QUALITY, HEAVY DUTY MATERIALS --- Expertly crafted with high-quality manganese steel and razor sharp triple cut teeth, the 7” blade is strong, durable, wear-resistant and anti-rust. Firm yet flexible, the Floro Folding Hand Pruning Saw is uncoated to reduce friction and allow for a smoother push and pull cutting motion.',
    'COMFORTABLE RUBBER GRIP --- Unlike other branch trimmers with cheap plastic handles, the reliable garden saw from Floro has a specially designed ergonomic red rubber handle. The comfortable, non-slip surface provides optimum grip for greater efficiency with less effort, perfect for strong and weak wrists.',
    'EASY TO FOLD, CONVENIENT TO CARRY --- The sharp blade of the portable sawtooth folds completely into the handle with no exposed teeth so you can quickly fold the hand saw and toss it in your toolbox, pocket or backpack without worrying about snagging or scratching. An adjustable bolt connects the blade to the handle which can be tightened to prevent hand saw blade wobbling.',
    'SAFETY LOCK TO PREVENT ACCIDENTS --- The saw is easy to open & close with a lock. Once folded into the handle, the secure safety lock stops the blade from being accidentally opened or closed. The lock catch must be pressed and held in order for the lock-in blade to appear, preventing unintended injuries.',
    'ESSENTIAL MULTI-PURPOSE TOOL --- More than just an amazing pruning and trimming blade, the multi-purpose folding hand saw comes in handy when backpacking, hiking, hunting, camping and working on the job site. The versatile pocket saw cuts through bone, plastics, natural wood and wood composites such as PPC wood.'

      The item feels lightweight in your hand. It does not feel as sturdy as I thought it would be. The value is great however. Would recommend to anyone that is an avid gardener and needs a hand saw.

      Exactly what I needed- a lightweight, inexpensive saw that could take care of little annoyances like trimming the bottom branches of my Christmas tree. Works perfectly, extremely sharp. One took a minute or two to saw through a branch about the size of my thumb. The folding feature is great for storage. Highly recommend.

      This is a handy tool for pruning branches that are too big for shears but not big enough for a regular saw. Very sharp. Easy to use.
