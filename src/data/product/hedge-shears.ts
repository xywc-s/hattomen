      title: 'Sturdy and SHARP!',
      content: 'They were very sharp and have been helpful in cutting parts of the lawn that my lawnmower couldn’t reach. I do like the angle that they have so that you don’t have to bend down so much to reach the grass. They do come with a screw on the plastic cover which you have to unscrew, but that keeps it stable.'
