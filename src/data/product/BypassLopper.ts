      content: 'I bought this to operate a heated blanket and plug in cooler for a winter car trip... i ordered it last min. And didnâ€™t think I would get it delivered on time, so I called the seller and Amazon rep to see if I could get it delivered quicker. Somehow the seller made it happen and it arrived the next day- just in time for the trip. The battery worked flawlessly and powered both the blanket over night and the cooler in the day. This is a fantastic little powerhouse and if it works as well as my Anker solar charger, I would expect this to be my go to for camping power for a long time.'
