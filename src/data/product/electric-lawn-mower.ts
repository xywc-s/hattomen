      title: 'Lightweight and very easy to operate',
      content: `I have a large backyard that requires lots of maintenance. The grass grows fast. I was looking for a lawnmower to complete this job. This lawnmower is very lightweight and easy to operate. It has an easy height adjustment knob that rotates to preference. The blade is also easy to remove and switch from a cutter to a rake. The grass catcher is easy to attach, and it collects the grass well. It's easy to add and remove. To operate this lawn mover, all you need is an extension cord, and when secured correctly, it will stay connected. So far, this machine works for me, and it makes this task`

      title: `Very light and easy to clean`,
      content: `Before buying this lawn mower, I was hesitant whether to buy a refueling machine or a charging machine. I was worried that the charging power was too small to cut the grass easily, because my backyard is very large and the lawn is very wide. But the oil mower is very expensive, so I tried to buy this one, the results surprised me, it is not only powerful, but also very light, not as heavy as the oil mower. It's also very simple to clean and easy to clean. It's a little loud, but I think a gas mower is about the same. It would be perfect if it had an extension cord. I'm very satisfied on the whole, thank you. `

      title: `Worth the money`,
      content: `This cute little mower caught my eye because of the price. It took just a few minutes to assemble with the easy-to-read direction and diagrams. I plugged it into an extension cord and wandered to the front of the house, raised the mower to the highest level because I don't like my grass to burn in the sun<br>
      I was skeptical at first; our lawn was too long this past month, but the mower went through it like a trooper.<br>
      <br>
      The grass hasn't gotten that long again, but I had used it when the grass was a bit wet—great results no matter what. The engine seems more than capable of tackling conditions that you would think would cause it to struggle in.<br>
      <br>
      It's lightweight, so it's not tiring to push, it's quiet (I always wear headphones, but I don't have to crank up the volume to hear over the motor), I love not fussing with a gas engine... Better for the environment, too (always conscious of that living in a larger city).`
