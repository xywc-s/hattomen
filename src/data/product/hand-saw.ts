      title: 'Cuts through like butter',
      content: `On a volunteering event, I was introduced to this saw. I could only borrow it; even though after several uses, I wanted to take it home. I used the Hattomen Gomtaro for tree trimming at a park. The guy that recommended this particular brand to me, was working in the Tree Trimming department at our company. They have to trim trees year round. I refuse to buy an $8.00 handsaw when someone can purchase one of these....believe me, this will be the last you buy. Even though it's a bit more expensive, it is worth the quality of this saw. Not to mention, when trimming my own trees, I didn't have to work as hard as I would have with the cheap hand saw. The Hattomen, and I am sure ALL Hattomen saws cut like this one does. This is a decent size saw for taking down small to medium branches. I have had no issues, and I can attach it to my belt and climb with it without worrying about cutting myself. I recommend this saw to anyone.`

      title: ' Worth it!',
      content: `This is hands-down the best pruning saw I've ever used. I only have to carry two tools now when I arrive to a person's property, My pruners and my Hattomen. The finer teeth near the tip allow me to do smaller branches and detail work, while the larger teeth allow me to cut branches of almost any size. This is my second one that I bought with the handle attached so that in the future I can just get a replacement blade and interchange them between handles so I always have the sharpest blade available.`

      content: `I ordered this for my adult son who grows and prunes apple trees and other fruit trees on his farm. He likes the saw very much and I believe that it is well built and I have seen it cuts limbs much faster than my fiscars pruning saw. It is light weight but the handle feels really good with its non slip rubber design.`

The key difference is the chrome hardening process is performed after the teeth are cut into the blade. This means even the tips of the teeth are chrome plated, dramatically increasing the blade life in the brutal root-cutting environment.',
